My solutions in Rust of the [Advent of Code
2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). 

**Disclaimer**
I took the opportunity to learn a new language I never used before, thus, the
solutions are not fast, not idiomatic nor memory efficient :) I never took time
to refactor the working solutions so the code in this repo is the first try
(idea) that worked. The part 2s are mostly copy paste of part 1 with the
appropriate changes.
